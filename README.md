# GuessANumberGameMVC
# Educational project to implement a simple number guessing game with saving stats based on MVC design pattern.
The solution includes a class library as Model and 2 projects to run the game: ConsoleApp and WinFormsApp that use one and the same Model
and provide proper implementations for Controllers and Views. This project is strongly focused on understanding MVC design pattern
and providing proper encapsulation.
